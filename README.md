# Minecraft Sirens

## About
I was building a nuclear reactor with Industrialcraft and realized that I wanted a nuclear warning siren. I couldn't find a mod that provided that, so I decided to learn minecraft modding to add it myself.
The mod, in it's current state, adds a nuclear warning siren that turns on with redstone power.
